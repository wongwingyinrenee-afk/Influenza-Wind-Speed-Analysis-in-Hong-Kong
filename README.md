# Influenza & Wind Speed Analysis in Hong Kong

This project investigates the relationship between wind speed and the spread of influenza in Hong Kong using public climate and health datasets from data.gov.hk. By integrating meteorological (Central Pier daily wind speed) and epidemiological (flu consultation and severe case) data, I conducted data cleaning, feature synthesis (including weekly aggregation), and analytical modeling in Power BI with DAX.

**Key highlights:**
- Built a robust data model linking wind speed, season and severe flu cases (including age group breakdowns)
- Developed custom DAX columns to aggregate flu cases, consultation counts, and risk proportions
- Visualized 5 aspects (case distribution, seasonal effects, age impact, proportional risk, and sensitivity controls)
- Actionable insights: found highest flu incidence at wind speeds 9–16 mph, elderly (65+) most affected, peak risk in Q1, and 91.85% of flu patients seeking private doctors

**Business & public health implications:**  
The analysis highlights the double-edged role of wind speed in flu transmission, demonstrates the vulnerability of older adults, and points to the difficulty of public health intervention when most patients rely on private clinics.

**Core skills demonstrated:**  
- Multi-source data integration  
- Data modeling (Power BI/DAX)  
- Data cleaning & feature engineering  
- Visualization and business insight extraction
